1. What is Javascript Object Notation[Json]?

- It's a way to format data that can be sent over the internet in a readable but also efficient way
- And as the name suggests, it's structured after a JavaScript Object.
- KEY[String] : VALUE pairs[String, Numbers, Arrays..etc.]

- you can have multiple properties in each object simply by adding a comma after each line.
- You can also have arrays inside your object and you can nest an object inside another object.


2. Difference between Json and Javascript?
- So the key difference is that a JSON is serialized into a string,
- as for most of the cases, when you're encountering JSON's it's because some piece of data is being
- transferred across the Internet, whereas a JavaScript object has a much more relaxed kind of notation
- because it can be interpreted by the editor or by the code interpreter.



- It is a string from the beginning to the end, and every single aspect of that notation is serialized
- so that it can be its minimal size when transferred across the internet.
- The syntax keeps all of the meaning and then when it gets transferred to the other side and when it
- needs to be used, it can then be re-expanded into a usable format such as a JavaScript object.


JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and JavaScript are related but serve different purposes:

1. Format vs. Language:
JSON: A lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It represents data as key-value pairs.
JavaScript: A programming language used primarily for creating dynamic content on websites. It allows for the execution of scripts in the browser.

2. Usage:

JSON: Used primarily for data exchange between a server and a client, often in web applications.
JavaScript: Used to create interactive effects, manipulate the DOM, and handle events on web pages.

3. Syntax:
JSON: Strict syntax rules (e.g., double quotes for keys and string values, no comments).
JavaScript: More flexible syntax (e.g., single or double quotes, allows comments).

In summary, JSON is a data format, while JavaScript is a programming language.


# Serializaion - Json to JS Object, packing 
- JS Obect to Json cabinet turns into flat 
- When you're writing code and you want to send a JSON across the internet, for some reason you will
- need to perform what's called serialization,

Syntax:
const jsonData = JSON.stringify(data);




# Parse - Json to JS Object, unpacking
- turns back cabinet from flat to original size
- Once you run the parse method, it turns this JSON back into a JavaScript object.
- Now the opposite direction when you want to unpack a JSON, when you are back home and you've got your
- flat pack and you're ready to assemble your wardrobe, this process is done using another JSON method,

Syntax:
const data = JSON.parse(jsonData);
